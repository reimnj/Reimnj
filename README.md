Welcome to my GitHub repository!, I'm Aladiah, I'm a self-proclaimed web developer and a software developer with no experience in the working industry just yet. I'm currently a learning back-end developer and an upcoming 3rd year student currenly based in the Philippines. I'm a fully experienced front-end developer who has knowledge in React and Angular frameworks. I have a project experience also in WordPress.


This is repository is currently under development as I am still finding my project in my university and I'm currenly making changes on my current projects.


Please look forward to my code documentations as I still have a lot to optimize in my previous projects.


Most of my software development project languages came from C, C++, Java, & C#.
