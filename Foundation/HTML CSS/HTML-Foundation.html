        <h3>A somewhat sort of introduction of my journey..</h3>

        <p>
          As stated above, I'm Aladiah Mehriel Fulminar. My family and friends
          call me by my names initials which is 'A' and 'M', combined, they call
          me "A.m" like as in when you're mentioning the time if its AM or PM.
          I'm 20 years old as of December 27, 2021 and would be turning 21 this
          year 2022. I'm currently a college student in a state university here
          in the Philippines called Technological University of the Philippines.
          My college course is Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. If
          you would ask me, I chose this course because it gives me a lot of
          options and some sort of specialized skill because I applied in
          Information Systems, here, you would of course learn on how to design
          and deploy systems for organizations, that is why I chose this course
          and it is very related to IT and CS courses because most jobs in this
          field require you to have a tech degree. If I somewhat fail in my
          current plans then this Information Systems job will be my last option
          but I do not really treat this as a last option, but a key skill
          because I have specializations in the tech field. And I went through
          many hoops as to what profession should I take under this field but
          I've decided that I would like to create websites because I was
          planning to create a website where I can socialize with people who
          also likes to watch asian dramas and watch and post drama clips
          through the website and have a reciprocity in reactions and lastly is
          to have forums in that website which is all about asian dramas and
          other topics available at a users disposal, moving on, during the
          second semester of my first year, I learned the fundamentals of web
          development in the front-end which is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I
          have learned HTML, especially the lastest markup version which is
          HTML5, I was not yet familiar with the semantic tags in which can help
          me divide my website sections clearly with the tags itself but as I
          have learned HTML and CSS, I went with the default learning of mine
          with the use of div tags to divide the sections of my page and of
          course div tag is very useful because you can create containers and
          control its elements through CSS without the hassle of dealing with
          the whole HTML body with only a single container through CSS which is
          possible but very impossible to arrange to a certain section of your
          website that is why CSS takes place when it comes to giving life
          through designs and modifying the elements position throughout the
          website. I learned to write semantic HTML throughout later as I have
          created my so called "crash" projects, those crash projects are just a
          trial and error projects I did when I learned HTML and CSS and I
          haven't created my very first working project yet and throughout this
          year. I'm planning to develop my first few working projects. With CSS,
          I learned the hard way, when I skipped major fundamentals and went
          through designing certain elements. The barrier that prevented me from
          having a fully fledged designed website is the fact that I have no
          idea on how to position the elements to where I liked them to be
          positioned at so I slowly learned the position elements, the box
          layout, grid, flexboxes, pseudo elements, the holy sizing elements
          such as the height, width, padding, margins from the CSS box layouts,
          and media queries because throughout my learning phase. I learned that
          in this generation, you should of course consider your website being
          mobile responsive and I learned the different methods of sizing the
          elements for it to be mobile responsive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my first college year, we studied C as our first
          programming language it it became my favorite programming language. It
          can be quite peculiar to know that my favorite language is a low level
          language and the mother of all existing high level programming
          languages that are used nowadays. But what made me fall in love with
          the language is that even though it is easier with high level
          languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and more. It provides
          the level of ambiguity in such a fact that you can program your own
          project on how you would best like it to be developed but from scratch
          (which is quite hard for a low level language, but hey, high level
          languages are written in C), since C is a low level language. Having
          an interest in having manual memory allocations, using pointers,
          dealing with a lots of libraries for a specific development task.
          Those are the ones that I liked about C as a programming language. And
          through C, I can easily bring ideas to life in embedded systems in
          laymans term, it is the utilization of other technology with the help
          of C to make use of them such as hardwares like keypads that we can
          see in security doors of a building, hotel, or may it be a house.

          Currently, <strong>as of June 2022</strong>. I'm learning the ways of
          being a <em>full-stack web developer</em> and I have an experience in
          JavaScript because I developed discord bots with the help of
          <em>JavaScript</em> because I was invested in creating a discord
          confession bot in which I used in our server to confess to my
          classmate. I worked part time last year, June 2021 as an apprentice
          web developer (all I did was to learn from them or to simply watch how
          they work) and learned how web developers design their website and
          make use of the backend technologies to give life to the website, but
          I haven't got to create a website of my own during those time but I
          learned a lot with <abbr title="frontend-path">HTML5 and CSS.</abbr>  Although CSS became a part of my
          challenge as a learner because I learned it from going through many
          hoops but it was fun and challenging because it is like a jigsaw
          puzzle that fits well together once you visualize the pieces and put
          it all together.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to fully grasp what I have learned, and to not go through
          anymore serious hoops of being stuck on what I should do. I've written
          this basic HTML file here to give purpose on the fundamentals of HTML
          that I have learned and I will keep on practicing the fundamentals
          before I hop on the major project that I can think of. This HTML file
          is created at the 25th of July. This marks as my "first" publically
          released progress of my learnings even though I learned frontend a
          year ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you would recognize I used the very basics of the HTML tags such as
          the header tags, emphasis tag, strong tag, paragraph tag, hr tag, and
          many more, just the fact that it can't be seen in the view of a
          browser unless of course, you check the content of the html file
          through the devtools of your browser. I also utilized the semantic
          tags of HTML5 and this helped me a lot because throughout my past
          "crash" project attempts, I used div tags a lot to divide the sections
          of my website without the use of the semantics that I wasn't even
          aware of. Now, with the use of semantic tags, I can divide my page
          sections with ease and it helped me to avoid confusion as to where on
          earth are my section containers at.
